I am going to be a teaching assistant for <i>Theory of Computation</i> next semester. I'm looking forward to seeing how it works from a teaching perspective!

I enjoy a variety of sports, epecially middle-distance and long-distance running. I placed 3rd in the Women’s 800m and 4th in Women’s 1500m in annual sport meet on campus. I also finished in the top 30 out of thousands of participants in the Tsinghua University Mini Marathon (4.2km) and Campus Marathon (10km).

I am an active member of a running club. <a href="../assets/img/runislove.jpg">Here</a> is a picture of our club members. We organize club activities three times a week. 

My roommates <a href="https://ziqing-huang.github.io/">Ziqing Huang</a> (NLP), <a href="https://wmdi.github.io/">Mengdi Wu</a> (computer systems and compilers) and Yaxin Tu (crypto) are also outstanding researchers in their areas. They are a great part of my undergraduate experience!
