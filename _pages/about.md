I am a senior undergraduate at [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/) (also [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/)), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). **I am applying for Ph.D. programs this year.**

I’m broadly interested in theoretical computer science, with a focus on cryptography and its interplay with other fields.

During my undergraduate, I am fortunate to be advised by great people. 
<ul>
<li>I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://www.chenyilei.net/">Prof. Yilei Chen</a> who sparked my interest in cryptography. </li>
<li>During the first half of 2022 I spent an awesome time working with <a href="https://www.cs.idc.ac.il/~elette/">Prof. Elette Boyle</a> in Reichman University in Israel and in NTT Reseach. It was also my privilege to meet <a href="https://yuvali.cswp.cs.technion.ac.il/">Prof. Yuval Ishai</a> in both places and have inspiring talks with him. </li>
<li>It was my privilege to talk to and learn a great deal from <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.vanbenthem/">Prof. Johan van Benthem</a> who sparked my interest in logic. Working with <a href="http://www.fenrong.net/">Prof. Fenrong Liu</a> and <a href="https://www.isichennai.res.in/~sujata/">Prof. Sujata Ghosh</a> to explore special modal logics was a great experience for me. </li>
</ul>
