I am a final-year undergraduate at [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/) (known as [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/)), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). **I am applying for PhD programs this year.**

My research interests lie in theoretical computer science. Recently, I have been particularly interested in understanding the fundamental difference between the quantum and classical worlds, and how quantum can help and challenge cryptography.

During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yilei Chen](http://www.chenyilei.net/).

During the Spring and Summer of 2022, I was fortunate to work on quantum cryptography, under the supervision of [Prof. Prabhanjan Ananth](https://sites.google.com/site/prabhanjanva) and [Prof. Henry Yuen](http://www.henryyuen.net/).
